## üåê Access the Application  

1. Open your browser and visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to access the front-end.  
2. The front-end communicates with the back-end running on [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).  

**Note: The current front app on github is communicating with the hosted backend on  [http://20.64.237.50:3000](http://20.64.237.50:3000) wich means running the backend locally isn't mandatory and if so it won't make a difference**
